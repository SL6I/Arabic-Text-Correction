# Baseline Script for Text Correction

## Overview

This script establishes a baseline model for the **Text Correction** task. It serves as a starting point for evaluating improvements and new methodologies.

## Objective

The primary objective of the baseline is to:

1. Evaluate the dataset quality.
2. Provide a simple and interpretable model for initial performance assessment.
3. Serve as a benchmark for comparison with future, more advanced models.

## Model and Approach

The baseline uses a rule-based approach or a simple statistical/machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression, N-gram Language Model) trained on the provided dataset. This ensures interpretability and reproducibility.

## Prerequisites

### Dependencies

Install the required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Dataset

Ensure the training and evaluation datasets are in the `data/` directory with the following structure:

```
data/
├── train.txt
├── dev.txt
└── test.txt
```

### Scripts

Ensure all required scripts are placed in the `scripts/` folder:

- `preprocess.py`
- `baseline.py`
- `evaluate.py`

## Steps

### Preprocessing

Preprocess the dataset to ensure proper formatting and tokenization. Run:

```bash
python scripts/preprocess.py --input data/train.txt --output data/train_preprocessed.txt
python scripts/preprocess.py --input data/dev.txt --output data/dev_preprocessed.txt
python scripts/preprocess.py --input data/test.txt --output data/test_preprocessed.txt
```

### Baseline Training

Train the baseline model using the preprocessed training data:

```bash
python scripts/baseline.py --train data/train_preprocessed.txt --dev data/dev_preprocessed.txt --model_output models/baseline_model.pkl
```

### Evaluation

Evaluate the trained baseline model on the test data:

```bash
python scripts/evaluate.py --model models/baseline_model.pkl --test data/test_preprocessed.txt --metrics results/baseline_metrics.txt
```

### Results

The performance metrics will be saved in `results/baseline_metrics.txt`. Check this file to understand the baseline performance.

## Next Steps

- Refine the dataset and preprocessing steps for better results.
- Experiment with advanced models (e.g., neural networks).
- Compare advanced models with this baseline to measure improvements.

## File Structure

The `scripts/` folder should contain:

```
scripts/
├── preprocess.py
├── baseline.py
└── evaluate.py
```

The `Baseline.md` file provides a starting point and standard for future comparisons.
