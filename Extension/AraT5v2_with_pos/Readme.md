# AraT5v2_with_pos

**AraT5v2_with_pos** At AraT5v2_with_pos, we believe that incorporating part-of-speech tagging into text can significantly boost accuracy. This enhances the AraT5v2-base-1024 model with POS information sourced from Farasa, a well-regarded Arabic NLP toolkit. By seamlessly integrating these linguistic features into the model’s pipeline, the system delivers superior correction performance and deeper language understanding.

## part-of-speech tagging (POS)

**part-of-speech tagging (POS)** tagging is the process of assigning a grammatical category—such as noun, verb, adjective, etc.—to each word in a text. This labeling helps in understanding the structure of sentences and the relationships between words, which in turn improves the accuracy and performance of various natural language processing tasks.

## Why part-of-speech tagging (POS)

In our model, incorporating part-of-speech (POS) tagging significantly enhances performance. It provides crucial syntactic context that helps the model understand word roles and sentence structure, leading to better accuracy and overall effectiveness.
