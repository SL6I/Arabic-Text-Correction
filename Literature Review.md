### Description
* This paper, the authors present the first results on Arabic grammatical error correction (GEC) using two newly developed Transformer-based pretrained sequence-to-sequence models. They also introduce a new multi-class Arabic grammatical error detection (GED) task and develop corresponding models. By incorporating GED information as auxiliary input, the authors improve GEC performance across diverse datasets covering different genres and proficiency levels. Additionally, they also leverage contextual morphological preprocessing to further enhance GEC model performance. *
* Their experiments demonstrate significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art systems on established Arabic GEC shared task datasets, while also establishing a strong benchmark on a recently developed dataset. This comprehensive evaluation, coupled with making their code, data, and pretrained models publicly available, provides a solid foundation for future research on Arabic GEC and GED.
Data: QALB-2014, QALB-2015, and a newly created dataset (ZAEBUC) *
